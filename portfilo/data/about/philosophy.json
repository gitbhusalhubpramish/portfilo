				"I was first introduced to programming in Grade 6 through Scratch at DigiSchool, where I learned the basics of problem-solving and logical thinking. After gaining this foundation, I chose not to depend only on teachers and formal classes. My curiosity pushed me to learn on my own, explore new ideas, and move forward at my own pace. Over time, this habit shaped me into a self-educated programmer at a young age, someone who believes that true learning comes from curiosity, effort, and creating one’s own path."
